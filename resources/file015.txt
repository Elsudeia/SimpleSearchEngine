nearly always attacked him soon after waking up It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps His veins had swelled with the effort of the cough and the varicose ulcer had started itching Thirty to forty group yapped a piercing female voice Thirty to forty group Take your places please Thirties to forties Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen upon which the image of a youngish woman scrawny but muscular dressed in tunic and gymshoes had already appeared Arms bending and stretching she rapped out Take your time by me ONE two three four ONE two three four Come on comrades put a bit of life into it ONE two three four ONE two three four The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winstons mind the impression made by his dream and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the Physical Jerks he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood It was extraordinarily difficult Beyond the late fifties everything faded When there were no external records that you could refer to even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness You remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing Everything had been different then Even the names of countries and their shapes on the map had been different Airstrip One for instance had not been so called in those days it had been called England or Britain though London he felt fairly certain had always been called London Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise Perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester He did not remember the raid itself but he did remember his fathers hand clutching his own as they hurried down down down into some place deep in the earth round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest His mother in her slow dreamy way was following a long way behind them She was carrying his baby sisteror perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying he was not certain whether his sister had been born then Finally they had emerged into a noisy crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube station There were people sitting all over the stoneflagged floor and other people packed tightly together were sitting on metal bunks one above the other Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears He reeked of gin It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin But though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable In his childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied had just happened It also seemed to him that he knew what it was Someone whom the old man loveda little granddaughter perhapshad been killed Every few minutes the old man kept repeating We didnt ought to ave trusted em I said so Ma didnt I Thats what comes of trusting em I said so all along We didnt ought to ave trusted the buggers But which buggers they didnt ought to have trusted Winston could not now remember Since about that time war had been literally continuous though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself
