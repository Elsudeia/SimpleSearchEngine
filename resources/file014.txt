eleven years old when his mother had disappeared She was a tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair His father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin dressed always in neat dark clothes Winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his fathers shoes and wearing spectacles The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him with his young sister in her arms He did not remember his sister at all except as a tiny feeble baby always silent with large watchful eyes Both of them were looking up at him They were down in some subterranean placethe bottom of a well for instance or a very deep gravebut it was a place which already far below him was itself moving downwards They were in the saloon of a sinking ship looking up at him through the darkening water There was still air in the saloon they could still see him and he them but all the while they were sinking down down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death and they were down there because he was up here He knew it and they knew it and he could see the knowledge in their faces There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things He could not remember what had happened but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own It was one of those dreams which while retaining the characteristic dream scenery are a continuation of ones intellectual life and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mothers death nearly thirty years ago had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible Tragedy he perceived belonged to the ancient time to a time when there was still privacy love and friendship and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason His mothers memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him when he was too young and selfish to love her in return and because somehow he did not remember how she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable Such things he saw could not happen today Today there were fear hatred and pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complex sorrows All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister looking up at him through the green water hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground The landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country It was an old rabbitbitten pasture with a foottrack wandering across it and a molehill here and there In the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze their leaves just stirring in dense masses like womens hair Somewhere near at hand though out of sight there was a clear slowmoving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside Her body was white and smooth but it aroused no desire in him indeed he barely looked at it What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture a whole system of thought as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time Winston woke up with the word Shakespeare on his lips The telescreen was giving forth an earsplitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds It was nought seven fifteen gettingup time for office workers Winston wrenched his body out of bednaked for a member of the Outer Party received only  clothing coupons annually and a suit of pyjamas was and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which
