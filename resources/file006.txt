fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people less levelheaded than oneself might be taken in by it He was abusing Big Brother he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia he was advocating freedom of speech freedom of the Press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayedand all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party and even contained Newspeak words more Newspeak words indeed than any Party member would normally use in real life And all the while lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldsteins specious claptrap covered behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian armyrow after row of solidlooking men with expressionless Asiatic faces who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished to be replaced by others exactly similar The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers boots formed the background to Goldsteins bleating voice Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room The selfsatisfied sheeplike face on the screen and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it were too much to be borne besides the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody although every day and a thousand times a day on platforms on the telescreen in newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashed ridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they werein spite of all this his influence never seemed to grow less Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police He was the commander of a vast shadowy army an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State The Brotherhood its name was supposed to be There were also whispered stories of a terrible book a compendium of all the heresies of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there It was a book without a title People referred to it if at all simply as THE BOOK But one knew of such things only through vague rumours Neither the Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen The little sandyhaired woman had turned bright pink and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish Even OBriens heavy face was flushed He was sitting very straight in his chair his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave The darkhaired girl behind Winston had begun crying out Swine Swine Swine and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen It struck Goldsteins nose and bounced off the voice continued inexorably In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoid joining in Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledgehammer seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current turning one even against ones will into a grimacing screaming lunatic And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp Thus at one moment Winstons hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all but on the contrary against Big Brother the Party and the Thought Police and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely derided heretic on the screen sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration and Big Brother seemed to tower up an invincible fearless protector standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia and Goldstein in spite of his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hung about his very existence seemed like
