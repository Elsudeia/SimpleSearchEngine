the paper was the decisive act In small clumsy letters he wrote April th  He sat back A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him To begin with he did not know with any certainty that this was  It must be round about that date since he was fairly sure that his age was thirtynine and he believed that he had been born in  or  but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two For whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was he writing this diary For the future for the unborn His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him How could you communicate with the future It was of its nature impossible Either the future would resemble the present in which case it would not listen to him or it would be different from it and his predicament would be meaningless For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper The telescreen had changed over to strident military music It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage The actual writing would be easy All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head literally for years At this moment however even the monologue had dried up Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably He dared not scratch it because if he did so it always became inflamed The seconds were ticking by He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him the itching of the skin above his ankle the blaring of the music and a slight booziness caused by the gin Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down His small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops April th  Last night to the flicks All war films One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water audience shouting with laughter when he sank then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it there was a middleaged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him then the helicopter planted a  kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood then there was a wonderful shot of a childs arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never Winston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down It was he now realized because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today It had happened that morning at the Ministry if anything so nebulous could be said to happen It was nearly eleven hundred and in the Records Department where Winston worked they were dragging the chairs
