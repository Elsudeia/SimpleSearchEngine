some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization It was even possible at moments to switch ones hatred this way or that by a voluntary act Suddenly by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches ones head away from the pillow in a nightmare Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the darkhaired girl behind him Vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax Better than before moreover he realized WHY it was that he hated her He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so because round her sweet supple waist which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm there was only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity The Hate rose to its climax The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheeps bleat and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep Then the sheepface melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing huge and terrible his submachine gun roaring and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats But in the same moment drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother blackhaired blackmoustachiod full of power and mysterious calm and so vast that it almost filled up the screen Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying It was merely a few words of encouragement the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken Then the face of Big Brother faded away again and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it had made on everyones eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately The little sandyhaired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her With a tremulous murmur that sounded like My Saviour she extended her arms towards the screen Then she buried her face in her hands It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep slow rhythmical chant of BBBBover and over again very slowly with a long pause between the first B and the seconda heavy murmurous sound somehow curiously savage in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tomtoms For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother but still more it was an act of selfhypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise Winstons entrails seemed to grow cold In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium but this subhuman chanting of BBBB always filled him with horror Of course he chanted with the rest it was impossible to do otherwise To dissemble your feelings to control your face to do what everyone else was doing was an instinctive reaction But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happenedif indeed it did happen Momentarily he caught OBriens eye OBrien had stood up He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met and for as long as it took to happen Winston knewyes he KNEWthat OBrien was thinking the same thing as himself An unmistakable message had passed It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes I am with you OBrien
