not know her name but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department Presumablysince he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spannershe had some mechanical job on one of the novelwriting machines She was a boldlooking girl of about twentyseven with thick hair a freckled face and swift athletic movements A narrow scarlet sash emblem of the Junior AntiSex League was wound several times round the waist of her overalls just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her He knew the reason It was because of the atmosphere of hockeyfields and cold baths and community hikes and general cleanmindedness which she managed to carry about with her He disliked nearly all women and especially the young and pretty ones It was always the women and above all the young ones who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party the swallowers of slogans the amateur spies and nosersout of unorthodoxy But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police That it was true was very unlikely Still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenever she was anywhere near him The other person was a man named OBrien a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching OBrien was a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarmingin some indefinable way curiously civilized It was a gesture which if anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled an eighteenthcentury nobleman offering his snuffbox Winston had seen OBrien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years He felt deeply drawn to him and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between OBriens urbane manner and his prizefighters physique Much more it was because of a secretly held beliefor perhaps not even a belief merely a hopethat OBriens political orthodoxy was not perfect Something in his face suggested it irresistibly And again perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face but simply intelligence But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess indeed there was no way of doing so At this moment OBrien glanced at his wristwatch saw that it was nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over He took a chair in the same row as Winston a couple of places away A small sandyhaired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind The next moment a hideous grinding speech as of some monstrous machine running without oil burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room It was a noise that set ones teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of ones neck The Hate had started As usual the face of Emmanuel Goldstein the Enemy of the People had flashed on to the screen There were hisses here and there among the audience The little sandyhaired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long ago how long ago nobody quite remembered had been one of the leading figures of the Party almost on a level with Big Brother himself and then had engaged in counterrevolutionary activities had been condemned to death and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure He was the primal traitor the earliest defiler of the Partys purity All subsequent crimes against the Party all treacheries acts of sabotage heresies deviations sprang directly out of his teaching Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond the sea under the protection of his foreign paymasters perhaps evenso it was occasionally rumouredin some hidingplace in Oceania itself Winstons diaphragm was constricted He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions It was a lean Jewish face with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee bearda clever face and yet somehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched It resembled the face of a sheep and the voice too had a sheeplike quality Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Partyan attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it and yet just plausible enough to
